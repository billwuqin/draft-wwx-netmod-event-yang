A YANG Data model for ECA Policy Management
Abstract
   This document defines a YANG data model for the Event Condition
   Action (ECA) policy management.  The ECA policy YANG provides the
   ability for the network management function (within a network
   element) to control the configuration and monitor state change and
   take simple and instant action on the server when a trigger condition
   on the system state is met.
