A YANG Data model for ECA Policy Management
Abstract
   This document defines a YANG data model for the Event Condition Action (ECA) 
   policy management. The ECA policy YANG provides the ability to delegate the 
   network management function to the server and control the configuration and 
   monitor state change and take simple and instant action on the server when 
   a trigger condition on the system state is met.
